      `I started coding directly with C++ in 6th Grade (which wasn't a great idea ;) ). Since then I have learnt (self-taught or courses or Chat-GPT-ing) languages like Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, C++, C, Assembly (I go all the way).`,
      `I have got into this field when I wanted to break open my RC car that was given to me on my birthday just to see what was inside of it. Ever since then, I have been building and breaking (both physical and code) things.`,
      `I have since built projects like an AI chatbot, a GPT-4 based memory game, a GPT-3 based resume generator, a Spotify-Youtube music player, a startup to deliver restaurant quality food at restaurant prices, an AI/CV website to convert images to recipes, a computer vision project to find the center of a phone, and a website to showcase all my projects.`
